import 'package:flutter_element/flutter_element.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Element Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElButton(
                type: ElButtonType.primary,
                child: Text('Primary Button'),
                onPressed: () {
                  print('Button pressed!');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              ElButton(
                type: ElButtonType.success,
                child: Text('Success Button'),
                onPressed: () {
                  print('Success!');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Theme Customization

Flutter Element provides flexible theme customization capabilities:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_element/flutter_element.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    ElApp(
      theme: ElTheme(
        primary: Colors.blue,
        success: Colors.green,
        warning: Colors.orange,
        danger: Colors.red,
        info: Colors.grey,
      ),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
